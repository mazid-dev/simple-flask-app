Project Title:


Flask DevOps CI/CD Project

A simple Flask application that uses a CI/CD pipeline with Docker and GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to Docker Hub.


Project Objective:

This project is created for hands-on learning of key DevOps concepts:

Source Control: Managing code versions with Git and GitHub.

Containerization: Packaging the application into a portable Docker image.

Automated Pipeline: Implementing CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) using GitHub Actions.

Cloud Deployment: Deploying the Docker container on an AWS EC2 server.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, ensure you have Git, Docker Desktop, and WSL installed on your system.


1. Clone the project:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
2. Run the application locally (using Docker):

First, build the image:

docker build -t <your_docker_hub_username>/simple-devops-app:latest .
Then, run the container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 <your_docker_hub_username>/simple-devops-app:latest
You can view the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

CI/CD Pipeline
This project includes an automated CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. Whenever new code is pushed to the main branch, the pipeline will:

Checkout the code from the repository.

Build a new Docker image.

Push the image to Docker Hub.

Important: For the pipeline to work, you must add two secrets to your GitHub repository settings: DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN.
